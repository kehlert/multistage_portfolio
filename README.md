Note: this is not a polished paper and project. It was just a class project, and I wanted to share it on Github. For an explanation of the code, see 719_paper.pdf in the "papers" directory.

Below is a plot from the paper. The portfolio consists of two risky assets (stocks) and one non-risky asset (safe bond). $\rho$ is the correlation between the returns of the two stocks. We can see that for a given average value-at-risk, we can achieve higher returns when the correlation decreases. For this plot, we were allowed to rebalance the portfolio at a single pre-specified time.
